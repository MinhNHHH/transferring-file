`transfer` is a tool that allows any two computers to simply and securely transfer file. `transfer` is the only CLI file-transfer tool that does all of the following:

- allows **any two computers** to transfer data (using a peer to peer)
- enables easy **cross-plaftform** transfer (Window, Linux, Mac)
- local server or port-forwarding **not needed**

The motivation behind transfer is to provide a safe and fast way to send file.
In order to achieve that, transfer uses a combination of WebSocket and WebRTC:
- WebSocket - is used only for signaling - which is a process to establish WebRTC connection
- [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org) - the primary connection to stream your terminal to other clients

# Getting started

## Install
1. Go to our [release](https://github.com/MinhNHHH/transferring-file/releases/tag/v1.0.0) page and get a pre-built binary of `transfer`. Make sure you get the one that match your OS.
2. Unzip the package `unzip cil-tool.zip`
3. (Optional) Move it to `/usr/local/bin` folder so that you could use `transfer` anywhere : `mv transfer /usr/local/bin`
4. Done.

## Usage 
1. Go to `www` and run command `npm run start`
2. To start a new session, just run `transfer send {{file_name}}`.
3. Transfer-file will echo out a connection url you can use to connect via:
  - Receive file with command: `transfer {{connection_url}}`

### Note
There are chances where a direct peer-to-peer connection can't be established, so I included a TURN server that I created using [CoTURN](https://github.com/coturn/coturn).

If relay to the TURN server is something you don't want, you can:
- Disable the usage of turn server (with `-no-turn` flag)
- Creates your own TURN server connect to it by changing in [cfg/transfer.go](internal/cfg/transferring-file.go)

## Upcoming
